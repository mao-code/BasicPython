# Exercise
1. Checking if a year is a leap year
    ```
        Input: 2024
        Output: 2024 is a leap year
    ```
   1. We are checking if the year is a leap year. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100, or if it is divisible by 400. (use % to get mod value)
   2. Extra: arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, %
2. Checking if a string is a palindrome
   ```
        Input: racecar
        Output: racecar is a palindrome
   ```
   1. A string is a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward.
3. Calculating the grade for a test score
   ```
        Input: 85
        Output: B
   ```
   1. A: greter than or equal to 90
   2. B: greter than or equal to 80 and lower than 90
   3. C: greter than or equal to 70 and lower than 80
   4. D: greter than or equal to 60 and lower than 70
   5. F: lower than 60
4. Finding the roots of a quadratic equation
    ```
        Input(a, b, c in int): 2, 3, 1 
        Output: The roots of the quadratic equation are -0.5 and -1
    ```
   1. Use the discriminant to determine if the equation has two roots, one root, or no real roots.
