# Exercise
1. Sum of Digits </br>
Description: Given a positive integer, calculate the sum of its digits. </br>
Example: Input: 12345, Output: 15 </br>
Tip: Iterate over the digits of the number by converting it to a string, and accumulate their sum.

2. Palindrome Number </br>
Description: Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. </br>
Example: Input: 12321, Output: True 

3. Fibonacci Sequence </br>
Description: Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms. </br>
Example: Input: 6, Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5] </br>
Tip: Use a loop to generate the Fibonacci sequence by summing the previous two numbers.

4. Prime Numbers </br>
Description: Find all prime numbers up to a given limit. </br>
Example: Input: 20, Output: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19] </br>
Tip: Iterate over the numbers up to the given limit and check if each number is prime. 

5. Reverse a List (cannot use reverse() or slicing) </br>
Description: Reverse the order of elements in a list. </br>
Example: Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] </br>
Tip: 
   * Use two pointers to swap elements from the start and end of the list until they meet.
   * swap statement or swap technique
