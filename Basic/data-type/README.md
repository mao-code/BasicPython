# Data types
## Numeric Data Types
* Int: 
  * The int data type represents whole numbers. Integers can be positive, negative, or zero.
* Float: 
  * The float data type represents numbers with decimal places. 

## Boolean Data Type
* The bool data type represents a boolean value, which can be either True or False. 

## Sequence Data Types
* Str: 
  * The str data type represents a sequence of characters. Strings can be created using single or double quotes.
* List: 
  * The list data type represents an ordered sequence of values. Lists can contain any type of data.
* Tuple: 
  * The tuple data type represents an ordered sequence of values, but unlike lists, tuples are immutable. 
  
## Set Data Type
* The set data type represents an unordered collection of unique values. Sets can be created using curly braces or the set() function.

## Mapping Data Type
* The dict data type represents a collection of key-value pairs. Keys are unique and immutable, and values can be of any data type. 

## Compare with tuple, set, list and dictionary
* A tuple is an <u>ordered, immutable</u> sequence of elements. Tuples are represented by parentheses (e.g., my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)).
* A list is an <u>ordered, mutable<u> sequence of elements. Lists are represented by square brackets (e.g., my_list = [1, 2, 3]).
* A set is an <u>unordered collection of unique elements.<u> Sets are represented by curly braces (e.g., my_set = {1, 2, 3}).
* A dictionary is an <u>unordered collection of key-value pairs.<u> Dictionaries are represented by curly braces, with each key-value pair separated by a colon (e.g., my_dict = {'key': 'value', 'another_key': 42}).
