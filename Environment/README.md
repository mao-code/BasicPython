# Environment
* Anaconda, Miniconda, and Miniforge are all distribution platforms for Python and other scientific computing packages. They are developed and maintained by Continuum Analytics (now owned by Anaconda, Inc.)
* Their goal is to provide a user-friendly environment for Python users to quickly set up and use Python with popular scientific libraries.
* We will use miniconda here

# Anaconda
Anaconda is a full-featured distribution of Python, including hundreds of popular packages for data science and machine learning. It comes with its own package management system, Anaconda Navigator, which provides a GUI interface for managing your packages and environments. Anaconda is a great choice if you need a full suite of scientific computing tools right out of the box.

# Miniconda
Miniconda is a <u>lightweight version</u> of Anaconda that only includes the Conda package manager and a few essential packages. You can then install additional packages as needed using Conda or pip. Miniconda is a great choice if you want more control over the packages you install, and don't need the full suite of scientific computing tools that come with Anaconda.

# Miniforge
Miniforge is a distribution of Python that is optimized for performance, and specifically designed for scientific computing. It is based on the Conda package manager, and includes a carefully curated set of packages that are optimized for performance and stability.
